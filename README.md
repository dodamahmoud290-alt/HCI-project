# Menoufia Governorate E-Portal – HCI Project

## Project Overview

This project is an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) redesign of the **Menoufia Governorate E-Portal**. The main goal was to improve the usability, user experience (UX), and visual design of the portal, which previously suffered from outdated aesthetics and poor interaction design. The project focuses on redesigning the **Home Page** and the **Complaints Page** to better support citizens in accessing government services.

## Problem Statement

The original e-portal design had several usability and design issues:

* Outdated visual appearance that created a negative first impression (poor visceral design).
* Long and cluttered pages that caused user confusion and high cognitive load.
* Inconsistent colors, fonts, and styles, making the interface hard to learn.
* Poor visibility and mapping, which made it difficult for users to find important services.
* Low efficiency, as users spent too much time searching for information.

These issues reduced user satisfaction and made the portal unsuitable for an official government website.

## Design Goals

The redesign aimed to achieve the following usability goals:

* **Effectiveness:** Help users find information and complete services accurately.
* **Efficiency:** Reduce time and effort needed to navigate the portal.
* **Safety:** Prevent errors, especially during complaint submission, using clear feedback and validation.
* **Learnability:** Make the interface intuitive so users can understand it without instructions.

## Design Principles Applied

The project applied core HCI design principles, including:

* **Visibility:** Important services and actions are clearly highlighted.
* **Consistency:** Unified colors, fonts, and button styles across all pages.
* **Affordance:** Buttons and interactive elements clearly appear clickable.
* **Feedback:** Immediate system responses (e.g., confirmation messages) inform users that their actions were successful.

## Before vs After Redesign

### Before Redesign

* Confusing layout with low visibility.
* High cognitive load due to excessive content and distractions.
* Poor visual hierarchy and weak mapping.

### After Redesign

* Clean and modern visual design.
* Clear visual hierarchy that guides user attention.
* Improved consistency and predictability.
* More enjoyable and comfortable user experience.

## User Experience & Emotional Design

The redesign improves the **visceral level** of emotional design by using a modern color palette and cleaner layout. These changes create a positive first impression and make the portal more pleasant and satisfying to use, while still maintaining its official identity.

## Tools & Concepts Used

* Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
* Interaction Design (ID)
* User Experience (UX)
* Usability Goals
* Design Principles (Visibility, Consistency, Affordance, Feedback)
* Emotional Design

## Conclusion

This project successfully transformed the Menoufia Governorate e-portal from a purely functional interface into a **user-centered, efficient, and visually appealing system**. By applying HCI principles and usability goals, the redesigned portal now better meets the needs of citizens and provides a smoother, more enjoyable interaction experience.
